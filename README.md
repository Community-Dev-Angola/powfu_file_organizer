# powfu_file_organizer


  This an utility script to help users organize their files without stress.
    It goes through a folder and check all files and organize them per type.
    Modules Used:
    shutil - provides utilities functions for copying, archiving files and directiry trees.
    os - it allows us to work with directories, files and so on.
    sys - This module provides access to some objects used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
  
    
    To use this:
    1. Copy main.pyw and runner.bat to the folder you want to organize. Please, don't try to organize C:\,  because it should contain files that can not be moved.
    2. Once copied, now you have just to run the runner.bat file. Att: I am using .pyw and .bat just to give you idea of the extensions of these files, depending upon your configuration, they may just be shown as main and runner;
    3. Everything is done, follow the instruction that you will receive.
    
    After organized, if copy news file to that folder, if you run again the runner, it will organize it depending upon the type of that file.
    This script is good to work on downloads folder, because it may contain some type of files that you don't have time to organize.
    
    You may contribute to this project if  you want, feel free to do that.
